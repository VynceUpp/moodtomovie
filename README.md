Whether you're feeling happy, adventurous, or nostalgic, this platform helps you discover the perfect movie to match your mood!

- **Hover Interaction**: Displays a movieâ€™s overview when hovering over the movie card.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts the number of visible movies based on screen size (1 movie on mobile, 4 on medium screens, up to 10 on larger screens).
